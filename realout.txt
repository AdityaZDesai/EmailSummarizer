) is an iconic American company that has played a pivotal role
in the development of the construction, agriculture and mining
industries around the world. Known for its yellow earth-moving
equipment and machinery, its history spans nearly a century.
The firmâ€™s origins can be traced back to the late 19th century
when the Holt Manufacturing Company produced steam tractor
machines. These early tractors were heavy and had difficulty
traversing soft ground. Benjamin Holt experimented with
increasing the size and width of the wheels, which resulted in
massive, 14-metre-wide tractors. However, this approach made the
tractors expensive and hard to maintain.
To address the issue, Holt came up with the idea of replacing
the wheels with wooden tracks bolted to chains. On Thanksgiving
in 1904, he successfully tested this innovation by ploughing the
soggy delta land of Roberts Island, California. This marked a
significant advancement in tractor technology and Holtâ€™s first
tractor sold in 1907 for US$5,500

, which is the equivalent of about US$128,000 when adjusted for
inflation.
Holtâ€™s invention allowed for significant productivity gains and
was a commercial success. Sales increased during World War I,
with tractor engines powering equipment on the battlefield and
tractors towing ammunition. However, this reliance on military
demand saw the company run into difficulty once the war ended.
The machinery the company sold was rarely used in the civilian
market, resulting in inventory and debt quickly piling up. The
financial situation would only begin to improve in 1925, when the
tractor giant merged with its biggest competitor, the C.L. Best
Tractor Company, to form Caterpillar Tractor Co.
DIGGING IN
Unfortunately for Caterpillar, the Great Depression then came
around. The firm faced significant challenges as the demand for
heavy machinery dwindled. However, the company's commitment to
innovation and continuous improvement helped it weather this
storm. It was during this period Caterpillar introduced diesel
engines to its products, which allowed for greater fuel
efficiency and more torque, marking a significant technological
advancement.
During World War II, Caterpillar would play an important role in
a major conflict once again. Its machinery was used for numerous
tasks, such as constructing airfields and moving supplies and
troops.
The companyâ€™s involvement in the war effort significantly
boosted its reputation and production capacity. As such, after
the war Caterpillar was well-positioned to meet the growing
demand for infrastructure development both in the U.S. and
internationally. The heavy-machinery manufacturer expanded its
product lines to include a wide range of construction and mining
equipment, such as bulldozers, graders and excavators.
The 1960s were marked by the brandâ€™s growing global presence.
The company established a network of dealers and subsidiaries
around the world, enabling it to serve customers in more than 190
countries. This global expansion was critical to Caterpillar's
success, as it allowed the company to diversify its revenue
streams and mitigate risks associated with regional economic
fluctuations. During this period, Caterpillar also introduced
innovative technologies, such as its first rigid dump truck, the
769. These advancements further solidified the company's
reputation for engineering excellence.
BUILDING FOUNDATIONS
Oil price rises and stagflation in the 1970s caused demand for

) gained a greater footprint in America, threatening the
yellow-tractor manufacturerâ€™s hegemony. The company responded by
implementing cost-cutting measures, streamlining operations and
diversifying into other businesses, such as financial services
(offering leases and loans for its customers to acquire
equipment) and engine production.
Although diversification helped make Caterpillar less dependent
on a single product line, the company was still very much exposed
to the construction business cycle. This exposure worked in the
companyâ€™s favour in the 2000s, as commodity prices skyrocketed
and demand soared not only for construction machinery, but
particularly for mining equipment. Caterpillar doubled down on it
and shares in the company nearly tripled in the period leading up
to 2008.
Despite the real estate bubble popping and the GFC taking
place, Caterpillarâ€™s revenue continued to grow due to the ongoing
commodity boom, eventually reaching US$65.9b in 2012. But as
recession hit the U.S. and metal prices fell, the industrial
giant faced serious troubles. Revenues almost halved

, declining to US$38b in 2016.
In response, the company embarked on a restructuring plan,
which included job cuts and streamlining the business. A change
in leadership ushered in a focus on cost reduction and improving
margins, setting the stage for Caterpillar's recovery. The
COVID-19 pandemic prompted further changes, with the company
reducing its inventory by about US$2 billion in a bid to enhance
efficiencies.
CONSTRUCTING GROWTH
Despite this, the company achieved a turnaround in 2021,
driven by rising commodity prices and increased capital
expenditure by mining companies. One of Caterpillarâ€™s biggest
growth drivers is also the rise of electric vehicles, which has
increased the necessity for mining metals such as lithium and
rare earth elements. However, commodities are also a notoriously
volatile industry and lower prices for metals can result in
projects being shelved.
Caterpillar is also positioning itself to benefit from
increased infrastructure spending under the Biden
administration's â€˜Build Back Betterâ€™ initiative, which is
particularly important considering 38% of the machinery
manufacturerâ€™s sales come from the United States. The company has
made investments in new technologies, such as remote piloting and
autonomous operation, but keeping up with industry trends and
customer demands requires significant financial and human
resources.
Caterpillar has amassed over 125,000 new customers in the past
five years and is financing 60,000 new machines annually. With a
fleet of 1.9 million construction machines in activity,
maintenance and repairs also play an important role in the
companyâ€™s revenues, which amounted to US$17.3b in Q2 2023, a
year-on-year (YoY) increase of 22%. Operational profit for the
quarter increased 88% YoY, amounting to US$3.65b. Many commercial
projects are dependent on government incentives and thereâ€™s a
chance the 2024 U.S. election could cause changes in some areas.
Caterpillar not only made more sales, but was also able to
charge higher prices as a result of a heated housing market in
the U.S. While existing homeowners benefit from mortgages with
fixed rates for the long-term in America, higher interest rates
and inflation have added extra pressure on those wanting to enter
the housing market. More expensive materials combined with labour
shortages could see demand fall due to affordability concerns.
For 2023, the company expects revenue to reach US$66.31b,
surpassing its all-time high of 2012. While Caterpillar has
managed to adapt, innovate and overcome challenges in the past,
achieving that number still depends on favourable housing market
conditions in the U.S. and commodity prices. In the case of a
recession, these targets are likely to be delayed. Whether the
role the company plays in providing the horsepower to drive an
economic recovery will be enough to regain revenue levels will
only become clear in the future.

 integrationFROM:  Stephen Barlow <feedback@render.com>Hey everyone! As we close out the week, why not check out what's new with your
friendly neighborhood cloud:
# Deploy your prebuilt Docker images
Render can now pull and run a Docker image directly from your container registry.
These new image-backed services can speed up your deploys significantly if you're
currently building from source with a Dockerfile.
You can pull public images from any registry, along with private images from
Docker Hub, GitHub, and GitLab. Learn more on the blog:
https://render.com/blog/deploy-prebuilt-docker-images
# View service metrics for different time ranges
While viewing metrics for your web and private services in your dashboard,
you can now choose from multiple time ranges. Zoom in on a hiccup from
the last five minutes, observe broader trends from the past week, or channel
your inner Goldilocks and go with something in between.
# Add Datadog monitoring to your existing database
Our Datadog integration for Postgres has been around for a while now, but you used
to need to contact us if you wanted to add it to an existing database. No longer!
Add your Datadog API key right from your dashboard:
https://render.com/docs/datadog
# Add a separate email for team billing
On your team's Billing page (https://dashboard.render.com/billing), you can now 
provide a billing-specific email address to receive invoices and other billing
information. The email address listed in your team's general settings continues
to receive build and maintenance notifications.
--
Thoughts or feedback? Let us know in our Community (https://community.render.com/),
or by replying to this email.
Have a great weekend!
